# 👋 Hi, I’m Majata Hichimi

I’m a **software engineering student and backend-focused developer** with a strong interest in **FinTech systems, databases, and security-focused development**. I’m intentionally **security-minded**, and I care deeply about how systems behave under real-world constraints, misuse, and failure — not just when everything goes right.

---

## 🧠 What I’m interested in
- Backend development & system design  
- Application and infrastructure security  
- Databases (especially PostgreSQL and modern cloud-hosted setups)
- FinTech infrastructure & financial systems
- Linux, terminals, and developer tooling

---

## 🛠️ Technologies I work with
- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go (learning)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Elysia, Bun
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Prisma, SQL fundamentals
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Docker (learning), CLI-first workflows

---

## 🔐 Security mindset
I approach software with security in mind by default:
- Thinking in terms of **threat models**, not just features  
- Being careful with authentication, authorization, and data handling  
- Preferring explicitness over magic  
- Designing systems that fail safely  

---

## 🚧 Current focus
- Deepening my backend, database, and security knowledge  
- Building real-world projects with production thinking  
- Understanding how software, finance, and security intersect  

---

## 💡 How I approach software
I value:
- Clear problem definition before code
- Simple solutions over clever ones
- Strong fundamentals over shortcuts
- Systems that scale without compromising safety
